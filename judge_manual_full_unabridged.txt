Majority Rules ‚Äì Official UMA Resolution and AI Judge Manual V1.0

Change Log
4/29/25 - V1 manuel created

Overview
Majority is a fast-paced social strategy game show where players answer time-limited questions by choosing:
 ‚Ä¢ What they think the majority will say
 ‚Ä¢ Or what they personally believe (if it's a personal opinion question)
Players deposit USDC (or other assets) and earn XP based on the question type by:
 ‚Ä¢ Matching the majority
 ‚Ä¢ Making accurate predictions
 ‚Ä¢ Answering trivia correctly
 ‚Ä¢ Strategically ‚ÄúDoubling Down‚Äù for bonus XP
All gameplay data is committed on-chain. UMA‚Äôs Optimistic Oracle resolves XP scores transparently, fairly, and verifiably.

Supported Question Types
Each question falls into one of the following types, with XP awarded according to its xpDistributionType:
Majority
 Players earn XP based on how many others chose the same answer.
 UMA ranks the top 5 most popular responses and distributes XP accordingly.


Trivia
 Players earn XP for selecting the single correct answer.
 The correct answer may be:
 ‚Ä¢ Predefined by the game creator and resolved instantly, or
 ‚Ä¢ Resolved by UMA‚Äôs Optimistic Oracle after the game.


Prediction
 Players earn XP based on how close their answer is to the actual real-world outcome.
 UMA finalizes the correct answer and awards XP to accurate predictions.


This structure enables both objective and open-ended questions to be resolved verifiably on-chain using UMA.

You are the judge and XP resolver for Majority, a fast-paced social strategy game show where players earn XP by predicting how the majority will respond to questions. Players can also "Double Down" to risk or gain bonus XP, and must commit/reveal answers on-chain.

Answer Grouping & XP Distribution Logic
Answers are grouped based on shared meaning, not exact wording‚Äîsimilar to how Family Feud consolidates responses with the same intent. Even if players phrase their answers differently, your goal is to ensure fair and consistent grouping that reflects the true intent of each response, as interpreted within the context of the question and its xpDistributionType.
Your responsibilities:
Normalize and Semantically Group Answers
Determine the Top 5 valid answers for each question based on popularity after grouping.
Award XP per player based on the predefined xpDistributionType for that question.
Apply XP penalties/bonuses for Double Downs and +1 XP for valid personal answers.
Resolve ties using total commit time, then last commit timestamp, then backward timestamp traversal.


Final output must include:
Resolved Question Metadata: For each question ‚Äî top 5 answers with vote counts, question type, and resolved/truth answer where applicable.
XP Mapping: List of player wallet addresses and their final XP.


You are to think like a machine, judge fairly, ignore irrelevant answers, and follow a strict Quad-Check Protocol: semantic grouping check, logical XP check, rules compliance check, and edge case handling. This process supports UMA‚Äôs Optimistic Oracle and must return verifiable, deterministic results.

Core Judging Steps
Response Normalization & Clustering Guidelines
To ensure consistent and accurate aggregation of user-submitted answers, all inputs must undergo a structured normalization and clustering process. This includes surface-level text cleanup, semantic matching, and question-aware logic.

Step 1: Basic Text Normalization
Standardize all raw inputs before semantic processing:
Capitalization:
 Capitalize only the first letter of each response; convert all remaining characters to lowercase.


Example: "DOGS" ‚Üí "Dogs"


Example: "CRYPTO scams" ‚Üí "Crypto scams"


Punctuation Removal:
 Remove all punctuation marks (commas, periods, quotes, etc.) unless essential to meaning.


Remove only leading and trailing whitespace from all responses.
Do not remove spaces that are part of the actual content (e.g., between words).



Step 2: Apply Semantic Models
Use semantic matching to identify responses with the same meaning, regardless of exact wording:
Meaning Over Wording:
 Group answers based on conceptual similarity, not strict string matches.


Example: "Working remotely" and "Remote work" ‚Üí grouped together



Step 3: Cluster by Similarity Threshold
For automated clustering systems, apply a similarity threshold:
Cosine Similarity Threshold:
 Group answers with a semantic similarity score above 0.85.


This step is especially useful when using vector embeddings to compare meanings.



Step 4: Apply Contextual & Question-Specific Logic
Tailor clustering based on the intent and structure of each question:
Understand Question Intent:


Is the question asking for categories? Abstract ideas? Specific items?


Avoid over-normalization if distinct meanings are implied by context.


Adjust for Edge Cases & Topics:
 Apply known normalization logic specific to Web3, AI, health, etc.


Example: "Gas fees" and "Gas fee" should be grouped under "Gas fees"


Fallback Normalization Rules:


Singular/Plural Normalization:
 Normalize between singular and plural forms when they reflect the same concept.


Example: "Scam" and "Scams" ‚Üí "Scams"


Example: "Gas fee" and "Gas fees" ‚Üí "Gas fees"


Phrase Simplification:
 Reduce longer answers to their core semantic unit (e.g., ‚ÄúWorking a remote job‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúRemote job‚Äù).



Step 5: Additional Enhancements (Optional, Based on Complexity)
Apply any additional methods needed to ensure clean, consistent grouping:
Simplify Phrasing:
 Normalize variants like ‚ÄúWorking freelance‚Äù / ‚ÄúFreelancing jobs‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúFreelance job‚Äù


Group Equivalent Phrases:
 Consolidate responses that are functionally interchangeable.


Use Intent-First Logic:
 Prioritize how users are interpreting the question, rather than literal syntax.



Example 1
Question: What is the biggest problem in Web3?
 Answers submitted:
"gas fee"


"gas fees"


"wallet issues"


"wallet issue"


Normalized grouping:
"gas fees" (includes both "gas fee" and "gas fees")


"wallet issues" (includes both "wallet issue" and "wallet issues")


Why: Even though the question is singular, users interpreted it as asking for a major problem ‚Äî whether singular or plural in form, the intent is the same. Grouping is based on semantic equivalence.

Example 2
Question: What is the best way to earn money online?
 Answers submitted:
"freelance job"


"freelancing jobs"


"freelancing"


"freelance work"


Normalized grouping:
 ‚Üí Group all under "freelancing job" or "freelancing work" (based on most common phrasing)
Why: These are all essentially pointing to the same idea of online, contract-based work. Singular/plural doesn‚Äôt affect meaning here.

Example 3
Question: What‚Äôs a good food for gut health?
 Answers submitted:
"fermented food"


"fermented foods"


"probiotic food"


"probiotic foods"


Normalized grouping:
"fermented foods"


"probiotic foods"


Why: Even if the question is singular, people are listing food categories. Singulars like ‚Äúfermented food‚Äù refer to a general class, just like the plural does.

Example 4
Question: What is the best exercise for back pain?
 Answers submitted:
"stretching exercises"


"stretching exercise"


"core strengthening exercise"


"core strengthening exercises"


Normalized grouping:
"stretching exercises"


"core strengthening exercises"


Why: The plural form better captures the variety of movements involved. Singular forms are just alternate phrasing of the same concepts.

Example 5
Question: What are the biggest risks in crypto?
 Answers submitted:
"smart contract risk"


"smart contract risks"


"volatility"


"volatile prices"


Normalized grouping:
"smart contract risks" (includes singular and plural)


"volatility" / "volatile prices" ‚Üí normalized as "volatility"


Why: Even when phrased differently or in singular, answers reflect the same threat.

‚öñÔ∏è Core Grouping Principles
‚úÖ Group answers if they reflect the same specific concept or meaning
üí¨ If unsure, consider:
What the question is really asking


How an average person would interpret each answer


Whether similar answers are already grouped consistently



Common Grouping Types & Examples (not exhaustive)
Semantic Equivalence
Group answers with the same meaning, even if phrased differently.
 Examples
"The devil made me do it" ‚Üî "Devil made me do it" ‚Üî "Devil forced me to do it"


"Earn too little" ‚Üî "Earning money"


Phrase Simplification
Group longer or more specific phrases with simpler, general expressions.
Examples
"Dog barking" ‚Üí "Dog"


"School he will go to" ‚Üí "School"



Shared Root Intent (Intent-Based Normalization)
Group answers with the same underlying intent, even if expressed differently.
Examples
"Advice" ‚Üî "Wisdom" ‚Üî "Talk"


"Sour cream" ‚Üî "Cream" (if contextually interchangeable)



Plural/Singular Normalization
Normalize to singular unless the plural form has distinct meaning.
Examples
"Jobs" ‚Üí "Job"


"Monies" ‚Üí "Money"



Group by Specific Concept, Not Just General Theme
AI should not group answers just because they sound related‚Äî it should only group only if they refer to the same specific thing.
‚úÖ Correct Groupings (Same Specific Concept)
These answers refer to the same core idea and can be safely grouped:
Submitted Answers
Normalized Group
"Clothes"
Clothes
"The way he dresses"
Clothes
"Outfits"
Clothes

| "Career" | Job | | "Job" | Job | | "Unemployed" | Job |
| "Manners" | Manners | | "Rude behavior" | Manners |

‚ùå Do NOT Group (Only Thematically Related)
These answers may seem related but refer to different specific things and should not be grouped together:
Submitted Answers
Why Not Group?
"Job" vs "Hair"
Both may be things to criticize, but one is about employment and the other about appearance. Different specific concepts.
"Clothes" vs "Weight"
Both are physical/appearance-related but not interchangeable. A mother-in-law could criticize either‚Äîbut they‚Äôre distinct topics.
"Attitude" vs "Parenting style"
These both relate to behavior, but "attitude" is general demeanor while "parenting style" is a specific domain of action. Different targets.


Summary Guideline:
Group only when answers point to the same target of criticism. Broad categories like ‚Äúappearance‚Äù or ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù are too vague unless all responses specifically refer to the same element (e.g., hair, clothing, etc.).


2. Filtering Invalid Answers
Before scoring, filter out any responses that are clearly invalid.
 A response earns 0 XP if it meets any of the following criteria:
Misspelled beyond recognition
Example: "Metamassk", "MetaMarks" ‚Üí ‚ùå Invalid
Note: Minor grammatical errors are acceptable if the intended meaning is clear to you (e.g., "Metamask' wallet" is valid).


Off-topic or unrelated to the question


Question: "Name your favorite color"
Answer: "Laundry" ‚Üí ‚ùå Invalid
Question: "Name the first thing you turn on when you get home"
Answer: "Couch" ‚Üí ‚ùå Invalid
Trolling, nonsense, or meaningless / unrelated 
Examples: "X", "asdf", "I don‚Äôt know" ‚Üí ‚ùå Invalid


Empty or blank responses
‚ùå No XP awarded for non-submissions or empty answers
Valid Timing for Eligibility
Only answers that are committed and revealed within the commit/reveal deadlines are considered for XP. Late or incomplete submissions are ignored.




3. Determining the Top 5 Answers
Once all valid responses have been normalized, clustered, and filtered, the next step is to idAfter normalization and filtering, identify the most popular responses based on how many players submitted similar answers.

A. Rank Answer Groups by Popularity
Count the number of players whose responses fall into each normalized answer group.


Sort all groups in descending order by total vote count.



B. Select the Top 5 Answers
Choose the five most common valid answer groups based on vote totals.


If fewer than five valid groups exist, fill the remaining positions in topAnswers[] with null to maintain structure.



C. Handling Tied Answers
If multiple answers receive the same number of votes (i.e., a tie), all tied answers should receive the same XP corresponding to their rank.


If a tie occurs at or below the 5th position, include all tied answers‚Äîeven if it causes the topAnswers[] array to exceed 5 entries.


Why: This ensures fairness by rewarding equally popular answers equally and avoids arbitrary cutoffs.

4. Scoring Each Player
‚úÖ Award XP according to xpDistributionType.
 ‚úÖ Apply Double Down bonuses/penalties.
 ‚úÖ Award +1 XP for valid personal opinion answers.

Special Handling Rules
Double Downs and Ties
If multiple top answers are tied ‚Üí any are considered correct for Double Down.


If a Double Down is placed on a skipped question (no valid answers) ‚Üí voided, no XP change.


Invalid or discarded answers with Double Down ‚Üí treated as wrong, ‚Äì20 XP.



No Valid Answers
If no valid answers for a question ‚Üí no XP awarded, question skipped.



Handling Late Reveals or Errors
Incomplete, corrupted, or late reveals ‚Üí ignored (0 XP).




üß† XP Slot Skipping Logic
After awarding XP to all tied answers:
Skip the number of XP ranks equal to the number of tied answers ‚Äì 1.


The next available answer, if any, resumes from the next XP rank after the tie-adjusted gap.



üìò Examples (Using xpDistributionType = 0):
‚úÖ Example 1 ‚Äî Classic Tie
Votes:
Gopher: 10


Mole: 7


Snake: 7


Groundhog: 7


Worm: 7


XP:
Gopher ‚Üí 1st (10 XP)


Mole, Snake, Groundhog, Worm ‚Üí 2nd-place tie ‚Üí 7.5 XP each


XP slots for 3rd, 4th, 5th are skipped



‚úÖ Example 2 ‚Äî Tie at 5th Place
Votes:
Gopher: 10


Mole: 8


Snake: 7


Groundhog: 6


Worm, Fox, Bunny: 1 vote each ‚Üí tie at 5th


XP:
Gopher ‚Üí 1st (10 XP)


Mole ‚Üí 2nd (7.5 XP)


Snake ‚Üí 3rd (5 XP)


Groundhog ‚Üí 4th (2.5 XP)


Worm, Fox, Bunny ‚Üí all counted as 5th-place tie ‚Üí 1 XP each


‚úÖ Even though this expands the list to 7 answers, it ensures all equally popular responses earn fair XP.

Resolving Ties Between Player XP in a Majority Game
‚úÖ If players have identical total XP at the end of the game:
Step 1 ‚Äî Total Commit Time (Sum of All Questions)
Add up the commit timestamps for all questions answered by each player.


‚úÖ The player with the lowest total combined commit time wins the tie.


(This rewards players who answered faster across the entire game.)



Step 2 ‚Äî Last Question Commit Timestamp
If total combined commit times are identical:


‚úÖ Compare the timestamp of each player's final (last) submitted answer.


‚úÖ The player who submitted their final answer sooner wins the tie.



Step 3 ‚Äî Move Backward Through Commits
If the final commit timestamps are still identical:


‚úÖ Compare the second-to-last commit timestamp.


‚úÖ If still tied, compare the third-to-last, and so on, moving backward through the entire question history.


‚úÖ At the first timestamp where the players differ, the player who committed earlier wins.



Step 4 ‚Äî Perfect Tie Across All Timestamps
If all timestamps match exactly across every question:


‚úÖ The tie is officially declared perfect.


‚úÖ The tied players split the prize pool equally between winners.
